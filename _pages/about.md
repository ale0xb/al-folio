Hello! I am Alejandro, **a research assistant and lecturer** at the Department of Computer Science and Automation at the University of Salamanca (Spain). I completed my **BSc in Computer Engineering** at the same university, from which I also obtained an **MSc in Intelligent Systems in 2016.** Before, I worked in UK and Spain as a freelance mobile developer and UX designer.

I am a member of the Visual Analytics and Information Visualization Group [VisUSAL](http://visusal.usal.es/) (within the Recognized Research Group [GRIAL](https://grial.usal.es/)), where I completed my PhD thesis *"Supporting Methodology Transfer in Visualization Research with Literature-Based Discovery and Visual Text Analytics"*. In my thesis, I developed novel visual text analytics methods to assist interdisciplinary researchers in finding **visualizations that can be reused across different knowledge domains**  such as digital humanities, sports science, linguistics or bioinformatics. To this aim, I combined several state-of-the-art techniques in the fields of **NLP, recommender systems, scientometrics, information theory and visualization.** I obtained the grade of Summa Cum Laude for my work ([thesis](assets/pdf/alejandro_benito-santos_cv.pdf), [presentation slides](assets/pdf/phd-thesis_slides.pdf))

My other research interests lie in the areas of **human-computer interaction** (HCI), **design**, **statistics** and **education**. I’ve had the chance to **teach HCI and introduction to python programming for statisticians** at the Faculty of Sciences of Salamanca in the past, which I enjoyed a lot. Currently, I am giving two courses in the [Master's degree on Bioinformatics and Computational Genomics](https://masterbioinformatica.usal.es/) offered by the University of Salamanca. 

My other research interests lie in the areas of **human-computer interaction, design, statistics and education**. During my time as PhD student, I had the chance to **teach HCI and introduction to python programming for statisticians** at the Faculty of Sciences of Salamanca in the past, which I enjoyed a lot. More recently (2020-2021), I gave two courses (introduction to programming and computational tools, respectively) in the **Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Specialization** of the University of Salamanca. Finally, I try to be an active member of the scientific community, and I reviewed for a variety of journals and conferences, such as IEEE VIS, the ADHO Digital Humanities Conferences (DH), IEEE Access, or the ACM Journal on Computing and Cultural Heritage (JOCCH), among others.
